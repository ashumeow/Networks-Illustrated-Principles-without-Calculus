<b>Question 1:</b>
```
Consider the following set of three links to a single base station in a cell. 
Each of their transmit powers are indicated, as well as the received power at the tower.

Given that the tower wants to receive each signal at 20 mW, 
what would the TPC algorithm dictate that the next transmit power of each device should be?

```
(i) A: 160 mW; B: 12.5 mW; C: 25 mW
(ii) A: 20 mW; B: 25 mW; C: 50 mW
(iii) A: 40 mW; B: 200 mW; C: 400 mW
(iv) A: 10 mW; B: 2 mW; C: 0.1 mW
(v) None of the above
