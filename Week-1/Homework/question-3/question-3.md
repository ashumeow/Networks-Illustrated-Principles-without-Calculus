<b>Question 3:</b>
```
For the channel conditions in the previous question, 
suppose DPC has been run for a number of iterations and the transmit power levels are currently

0.520 mW for A,

0.693 mW for B, and

0.540 mW for C.

Which of the following statements is true?

(i) The algorithm has converged to an equilibrium, because all of the target SIRs have been met (within reason).
(ii) The algorithm has converged to an equilibrium, even though none of the target SIRs have been met.
(iii) The algorithm has not yet converged, because none of the target SIRs have been met.
(iv) The algorithm has not yet converged, because the target SIR of Link A has not been met, even though the others have (within reason).
(v) The algorithm has not yet converged, because the target SIR of Link B has not been met, even though the others have (within reason).
(vi) The algorithm has not yet converged, because the target SIR of Link C has not been met, even though the others have (within reason).
